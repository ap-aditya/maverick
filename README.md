# ü§ñ Maverick: Your Personal AI Career Agent

MAverick is a comprehensive, autonomous system designed to automate the entire job search and application tracking process. It combines a powerful Python-based AI agent with a modern, interactive Next.js web dashboard to create a personalized career management cockpit.

The agent proactively scours the web for relevant job opportunities, performs a deep analysis against your personal profile, and saves the enriched data. The dashboard then provides a clean, intuitive interface to view these findings, track your application progress, and gain insights into your job hunt.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### ü§ñ Backend Agent (`agent/`)

- **Automated Job Sourcing**: Scans multiple job boards and company career pages based on a simple `config.json` file.
- **Intelligent Data Extraction**: Uses LLMs (Groq) to understand page content, reliably extracting job listings and handling pagination without brittle selectors.
- **Personalized Fit Analysis**: For every new job, the agent scrapes the full description and compares it against your stored professional profile to generate:
  - A **Match Score** (1-10)
  - A concise **Match Summary**
  - Lists of **Matching & Missing Skills**
  - Extracted **Salary Range** and **Company Info**
- **Efficient Pre-Filtering**: Checks for duplicate jobs against the database before performing expensive analysis to save time and resources.
- **Scheduled & Autonomous**: A GitHub Actions workflow runs the agent automatically on a daily schedule, ensuring a continuous flow of new opportunities.

### üåê Frontend Dashboard (`frontend/`)

- **Secure Authentication**: A simple but secure password-protected login system to keep your dashboard private.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays all discovered jobs in a clean card layout with prominent, color-coded match scores.
- **Powerful Filtering**: Instantly search and filter jobs by title, company, status, or minimum match score.
- **Detailed Job View**: A slide-out drawer shows the full AI analysis, including matching/missing skills and any extracted salary data.
- **On-Demand Resume Tailoring**: An AI-powered feature that generates a tailored professional summary and resume bullet points for any specific job you're interested in.
- **Spreadsheet-Style Application Tracker**: A robust data table to manage your application pipeline with customizable statuses (Interested, Applied, Interviewing, etc.) and an "Edit" feature.
- **Visual Analytics**: An analytics page with interactive charts, including an application pipeline and match score distribution, with date-range filtering.
- **Editable User Profile**: A dedicated page to view and update your professional profile, ensuring the agent's analysis is always based on your latest information.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

#### Required
- **Python 3.11+** (recommended for optimal performance)
- **Node.js 24+** (for frontend dashboard)
- **PostgreSQL database** ([Neon](https://neon.tech) recommended)
- **GROQ API key** ([Get free key](https://console.groq.com))

#### Optional
- **Git** (for cloning and version control)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ap-aditya/maverick
cd maverick
```

### 2. Backend Agent Setup (`agent/`)

The Python agent uses `uv` for package management.

```bash
# Navigate to the agent directory
cd agent

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all dependencies (including Playwright) using uv
pip install uv
uv sync

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open `agent/.env` and fill in your `GROQ_API_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL`.

### 3. Frontend Dashboard Setup (`frontend/`)

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open `frontend/.env.local` and fill in your credentials

### 4. Database Initialization

This is a one-time setup to create your database tables and populate your profile.

```bash
# From the agent/ directory (with virtual environment active)

# 1. Edit populate_profile.py with your professional info, then run it
python populate_profile.py
```

### 5. Configure Job Targets

The agent comes pre-configured with 25+ high-value targets. To customize:

```bash
# Edit config.json to add/remove job sites
nano config.json
```

### 6. Running the Application

You will need two separate terminal windows.

**Terminal 1 (Backend Agent):**
```bash
cd agent
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend Dashboard):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.


## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

### Backend Agent (GitHub Actions)
The Python agent is designed to be run automatically via the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/run_agent.yml`.

**Required Repository Secrets:**
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your GROQ API key
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

**The workflow runs daily at 2:00 AM UTC (7:30 AM IST)**

### Frontend Dashboard (Vercel)
The Next.js frontend is designed to be deployed to Vercel.

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set **Root Directory** to `frontend` in Vercel project settings
3. Add all necessary environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically on push to main branch
